"""

    Auto-discover log files and generate logrorate config based on it.

    - Find any folders containing log files

    - Add logrotate entry for *.log files in that folder

    - Try to signal Zope application server after log rotation to release the file
      handle and actually release the disk space associated with it

    http://collective-docs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/hosting/zope.html#log-rotate

    http://man.cx/logrotate

    Usage example for Ubuntu / Debian::

        sudo -i -u  # root
        # Generate a log rotate config which is automatically
        # picked up by a log rotate on the next run
        discover-log-rotate /etc/logrotate.d/plone-all /srv/plone
